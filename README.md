## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation 

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) & npm
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- pip (Python package manager)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running locally (for the AI model used by Quiz Backend)

---

### Steps

1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hemadiksitha/PERSONALIZED_LEARNING.git
    cd PERSONALIZED_LEARNING

2. Start Ollama
    ‚ö° Important:
    Make sure Ollama is installed and the required model is pulled.
    Example:

    ```bash
    ollama pull llama2
    ollama serve
    Confirm that your Ollama server is running before starting the Quiz Backend.

3. Setup Quiz Backend (quiz-backend)
    Open another new terminal, then:

    ```bash
    cd quiz-backend
    # (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
    # python -m venv venv
    # source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/Mac)
    # venv\Scripts\activate     (Windows)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run Flask server
    python app.py

    This starts the Python backend for MCQ generation & evaluation.

4. Setup Editor Backend (editor-backend)
    Open a new terminal, then:

    ```bash
    cd editor-backend
    npm install
    # Create a `.env` file for sensitive configs if needed
    node app.js

    This starts the Node.js backend for the adaptive code editor.

5. Setup Frontend (client)
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run build   # Optional: To build production version
    # For development:
    npm start

6. Access the Platform
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Editor API: usually http://localhost:5000
- Quiz API: usually http://localhost:5001
- Ollama : http://localhost:11434 (default)
